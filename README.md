# Hapi-client-proxy
Creating a reverse proxy pattern for client to hapi

# Concept
To funnel requests from the client(browser) through hapi(nodejs) to an endpoint.

While still using hapi to render templates :smirk:

So all endpoint requests are made by hapi.

- Create proxy
- Create templates (for benchmark load)
- Benchmark results
